## Before we begin...

Please note that opinions shared in this presentation are my own. They do not reflect at any point opinions of my employer or other clients I might be working for. I am passionate about the Vue.js and as such at times I can get carried away. If you disagree with me or want to know more about a certain part of the material presented please don't hesitate to speak up! The presentation will probably be more interesting for everyone if we stay interactive!

## What is a framework and what is a library?

###### Framework
- takes control over program execution
- calls your code to do pieces of work

###### Library
- you call a library to do some work
